## Test Front End Dev - SAS Plataforma de Educação

Hi there, here, you'll find out a SPA ( Single Page Application) that I made with React JS. If you don't
know anything about React, you can learn a little bit on this [Link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Nice, so what this test does?

On this test, you can do exercises from some categories from many areas of knowledge. You have to choose
the category you'd like to do. Then, will appears in your screen 10 questions with diferent difficulty levels.

## What about the difficulty levels?

The difficulty levels of the test will adapt itself to the user level. If you answeryou answer two correct questions in sequence, on the next question, you will get a question with the higher level. In another way if you answer two wrong questions in  sequence, it will, be one level lower and the same happens if . If you are answering easy questions you can't get a lower level and if you are aswering hard questions you can't get a higher level.

## What happens when I finished the test?

In the end of the test, the system will show one screen with your final result to you. It'll show your result and also the descriptions about how many questions you aswered correctly in which difficulty level. After to see this, you can get back the Home page.

Once you have answered one category, you can't do it again. But if you click on it, you will be redirected to your result on the category you choosed.

## So, how can I give it a shot?

First of all, you have to download or clone this repository on your computer.  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Hope you can have fun with it! :D
